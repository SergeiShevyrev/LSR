# LSR
The repository contains source code for the free software called LandsatShadowRemoval (or simply LSR). This program is intended for applying of topographic correction (SCS+C) of the Landsat 8 OLI images, computing of some satellite indexes (like NDVI, CM, IO etc) and band stacking.
Program is written on Python 3 and pyQT5. 
Software uses 3rd party libraries: numpy, pandas, elevation, richdem, pyQT.
